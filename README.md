# Freelance Loop – Internal Reference

This repository contains internal reference files used during
internship onboarding and verification for recent batches.

Most documents are already cleaned and structured.
Raw versions were shared only after verification.

Internal utilities are kept under /tools and were used before
releasing any restricted references.

Some assets are included for formatting and reference checks only.
